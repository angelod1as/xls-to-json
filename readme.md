# XLS to JSON

I did this Node.js script while working at [this project](https://github.com/angelod1as/escolha-escola-folha). Maybe you can make this work for you too.

## Description

A Node.js script that splits a (usually huge) XLS file into multiple small JSON files.

Good for data visualization â€” from that hideous spreadsheet from accountability to many tiny files for web consumption.

Unfortunately it's very usage specific, so you are free to fork and mess with it. I'd love to see a more user-friendly approach to this.
